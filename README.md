# forkify-v2
A second version of the forkify project, rebuilt from the ground up using instructors new lessons.

A big project that was redone with the ES6 syntax and slightly stronger focus on the MVC design pattern this time around.
It was interesting to revisit the code with a revamped UI, and learn it all over again. 
Plus some additional features such as API-Specific results, have been added this time around.

#### Please message me directly, and I would be happy to share the URL with you to test this app out.
